# todoui — Claude Code instructions

The main package is at the module root — `go build .`, `go install github.com/datapointchris/todoui@latest`.
Any path naming `./cmd/todoui` is stale.

## How to run and test

**Use `direnv exec . go run .` from the repo root. Do not build throwaway
binaries to `/tmp` and do not seed synthetic databases.**

`.envrc` pairs a dedicated dev database with the sync API's local dev stack, so
nothing run here touches production data. This is the whole file:

```bash
export TODOUI_DB="$HOME/.local/share/todoui/dev.db"
export TODOUI_SYNC=true
export TODOUI_SYNC_URL="https://api.docker.localhost"
```

The dev API needs no token, because its proxy injects the user header. The
server's own repo starts it, and the first sync binds `dev.db` to it. Its seed
data carries notes one line long. A change about notes needs a real-length
markdown note written into the dev API first.

⚠️ **`.envrc` is machine-local and is not in this repo. Check it exists before
running anything here.** Without it nothing is overridden, so `go run .` opens
the production database against the production API — which is the accident the
coupled-variables rule below exists to prevent, arrived at from the other
direction. `task setup`, which `worktree new` runs, links the primary
checkout's `.envrc` into a worktree.

**A shell without direnv's hook ignores `.envrc`, and Claude Code's tool shell is
one.** There, a bare `go run .` opens production even with the file in place.
Load it explicitly:

```bash
direnv exec . go run .        # TUI against dev.db
direnv exec . go run . sync   # one reconcile against the dev API
direnv exec . env | rg '^TODOUI'   # nothing printed: no .envrc here
```

Build, vet and test check code correctness, not TUI correctness. Do not claim a TUI change
verified without driving it with `go run .`; if you cannot, say so and hand the manual steps to
the user rather than substituting a synthetic smoke test.

`tui/app_test.go` drives the model directly: `newTestApp` builds an app over an in-memory DB, and a
test feeds it `tea.KeyMsg` values and asserts on state or on `View()`. `send` follows the whole
command chain, so a create and its refresh have both landed before the assertion, and it abandons
`tea.Tick` commands rather than sleeping out their duration. A layout bug that appears only at one
window size is reproducible here and invisible in a manual pass. It does not replace driving the TUI.

## todoui is a TUI; there is no item CLI

todoui is driven through the TUI. Agents and scripts reach the same projects and items through
ichrisbirch's own CLI against the API. The subcommands here are `sync`, `update`, `version` and
`completion`, and none of them reads or writes an item. A verb added here would be a second front
door onto rows ichrisbirch's CLI already owns, spelled independently of it.

An item shows its **number**, the handle ichrisbirch assigns and prints. The UUID is the sync key
and stops there.

The number is assigned by whichever database is the authority. With sync on that is the API, and
`pushCreatedItem` writes the number from the create response into the local row, so the TUI shows
it once the push lands rather than after the next pull. With sync off, `AssigningItemNumbers` makes
todoui allocate `max+1` itself, which cannot collide because that database is a disjoint universe.

An item created while the API is unreachable has no number until its push lands, and shows its UUID
tail until then (`itemHandle` in `tui/app.go`).

## A project name is bounded work, never a repo

Creating a project refuses a name the repo registry knows, and so does a rename.
The test is whether the thing ENDS, not whether the name reads like a verb
phrase:

    "todoui sync improvements"    OK — the sync improvements end
    "Extract xx from dotfiles"    OK
    "Migrate neovim to vim.pack"  OK
    "todoui"                      banned — names a thing that exists

The failure it prevents: a repo gets a project while it is being BUILT, which is
finite and does complete. The repo then keeps existing, the next papercut has
nowhere else to go, and the finished effort silently becomes the eternal bucket.
The tell was dotfiles' own description, which had grown a hand-written BOUNDARY
paragraph explaining which work belonged to it — a modeling gap patched with
prose.

The repo association is the item's repo tag, which already crosses project
boundaries and outlives any single project. "What is the dotfiles work" is a
query on that tag, spanning live projects, finished ones, and whatever is filed
elsewhere.

A one-item project is the floor, not the target: fifteen papercuts are four or
five small thematic projects, not fifteen projects. If the ban produced one
project per item the list would read like items, which is the complaint that
started this.

A missing registry bans nothing.

Enforcement is on the backend (`RefusingRepoNames`), the one path every create
and rename takes.

## A project has a status, and it is not an `archived` flag

`projects.status` is `active`/`someday`/`completed`/`dropped`. For an item, complete and archive are
orthogonal; for a project they collapse, because a project is a finite effort with a definition of
done, so completion *is* the hide signal. `dropped` requires a reason: "deferred" invites
re-proposal, "dropped, and here is why" closes the question.

`someday` is shelved, not closed. It is hidden and gives up its name like a closed project, but
`closed_at` stays NULL, matching the API. So "is it closed" and "is it hidden" are different
questions: the TUI asks `status != active` for hiding and for offering reopen.

`SetProjectStatus` is the only write path, and `closed_at` and `status_reason` are derived inside
its statement rather than accepted from a caller, so an active project can never carry either.
`UpdateProject` deliberately does not touch status.

**Closing a project does not cascade to its items.** An item still open when the project was
dropped WAS still open; "shipped 8 of 11, dropped with 3 open" is a real signal and eleven archived
items is not. Visibility is derived from the project instead.

**A name is held only by the active project bearing it.** That is
`idx_projects_name_active` in `indexes.sql`, a partial unique index, and it is
what lets a finished `clisteno` give the name back.

`migrateProjectStatus` is the one migration that rebuilds a table rather than
adding columns, because SQLite attaches the old column-level `UNIQUE(name)` as
an implicit index no DDL can drop. Foreign keys are off across the swap:
`project_item_memberships` cascades off `projects`, so dropping the old table
with them on would take every membership. Do not simplify it into three
`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`s — leaving the global constraint in place fails the
entire pull transaction the first time the server returns a done project beside
a live one sharing its name.

## A database and its API are a pair — never mix a dev half with a prod half

`.envrc` exports two coupled variables, `TODOUI_DB` and `TODOUI_SYNC_URL`, and
`TODOUI_SYNC_TOKEN_COMMAND` where the dev API wants a token. They name one
environment. A URL from the environment never takes the config file's
`token_command` (`config.Load`), so the dev URL cannot carry the production
token. Overriding one of them names an environment that does not exist, and
for this tool that is destructive rather than merely wrong: a pull deletes
every local row the server did not return, so
a production database reconciled against the dev API is emptied of everything
dev has never heard of. A sync run that way once deleted 42 projects and 286
items and printed `Synced.`

**To run against production data, run from outside this repo**, where direnv has
loaded nothing. Un-setting your way out is how the accident happened: `env -u`
on the variable you remembered still leaves the one you did not.

`sync_origin` is the enforcement, because a rule only prose enforces is
decoration. The first pull records which API the database belongs to, and every
pull and push after that refuses any other (`OriginMismatch`). `--adopt` is the
only way the pairing changes. A database that has pulled before but carries no
origin — anything predating this — refuses to guess and asks to be bound, since
inferring it from whichever environment is loaded *is* the mistake.

`guardSweep` is the second layer, for when the API is right but its answer is
not. A pull that would delete ten or more local projects, and more than half of
them, is refused, and items are guarded the same way. A truncated response, an
auth failure that still returns 200, and a genuine mass deletion are the same
event seen from here. `--force` allows it. The floor counts rows deleted, not
rows held, so 8 deletions out of 15 pass. It keeps the guard silent on small
databases, where losing most of it is a handful of rows; a guard that fires on
ordinary days gets forced past by reflex and stops guarding anything.

Neither override is reachable from the background timers. A guard something
automatic can waive is not a guard.

## Sync is automatic; `todoui sync` is a convenience, not a requirement

`sync.interval` (default 2m, floored at 15s) is the single knob for how stale todoui may ever be,
and it drives two loops:

- **TUI** — `syncPullTickMsg` re-arms itself every interval, and always reschedules, even on the
  ticks it skips: a tick that returns no command kills background sync for the session.
  `safeToAutoPull` gates the reconcile to `modeNormal`, because a pull rewrites items, memberships
  and ordering wholesale and would move the ground under a grab or a text entry.
- **Push** — `pushLoop` carries a retry ticker alongside `Notify`, which fires only on a local
  mutation, so a push that failed while the API was down retries without another edit.

An automatic pull neither flashes on success nor claims the status bar on failure; failure surfaces
through the engine status (`SYNC ERR`). Local-first means an unreachable API degrades to local
data, never an error.

`Pull` records a pending-sync high-water mark before it fetches, then clears only the ops at or
below it and spares entities queued above it from the "deleted upstream" sweeps. Without that mark,
an item typed mid-pull is deleted by the same pull and its queued create dropped with it. Do not
restore `DeleteAllPendingSync` here.

**Absent is not empty, and that is what keeps deploy order between this repo and ichrisbirch
irrelevant.** The item list embeds memberships, dependencies and tasks; when the server omits
`dependency_ids`/`tasks`, the pull falls back to the per-item endpoints — decode into slices and
branch on nil, never on empty, or the first pull against an older API deletes every local task and
dependency. The project pull asks for `?status=all` because the sweep deletes any local project the
server did not return, so an active-only response would read "completed" as "deleted" and cascade
through the memberships. A server sending no project status is read as `active`. Do not drop either
fallback just because the API has shipped.

## Never write the breaking-change trailer in a commit message

Those two words anywhere in a message cut a major here, and a major on a Go module
with no `/vN` path is an outage: `go install …@latest` stops seeing the tag, every
installed binary is stranded, and recovery is a reinstall on each machine. The
analyzer matches unanchored and ORs past `.semrelrc`, so nothing switches it off.
A commit that merely *discusses* the trailer cuts one too — say "that marker".
Deliberate majors are `chore(release-major)`, and the same release adds the
`/vN` suffix to the module path.

History cannot be rewritten on `main`, so a major cut by accident is reset in
this order:

1. Delete the vN GitHub releases and their tags, remote and local.
2. Tag a baseline on `main` above the offending commit, and push it. Without it
   the commit stays in the analyzed range and the next push cuts the major again.
3. Confirm `go list -m github.com/datapointchris/todoui@latest` answers the v1 tag.
4. Reinstall on every machine. Self-update will not recover a stranded binary.
